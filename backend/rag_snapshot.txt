SALES DISCOVERY:
Effective sales calls include open-ended discovery questions.
Sales reps should ask about customer needs, budget, and timeline.

CLOSING:
A good sales call includes a clear next step or closing question.
Lack of a closing attempt often leads to deal stagnation.

OBJECTIONS:
Price objections should be acknowledged with empathy.
Sales reps should explain value before offering discounts.

TONE:
Sales conversations should maintain a confident and empathetic tone.
Interrupting customers or rushing responses reduces trust.
