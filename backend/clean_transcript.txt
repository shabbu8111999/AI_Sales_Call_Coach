Hello, this is Dax, calling from Bright Net Services. Am I speaking with Shiv? Yes, this is Shiv. Thank you for taking my call, sir. I am calling to talk about our home internet plans in your area. Is this a good time to speak for a few minutes? Yes, I can talk for a short time. Great We recently upgraded our network in your locality. We are offering a stable, high-speed internet connection with flexible monthly plans. I wanted to check if you're currently using any internet service. Yes, I am using another provider right now. Understood, sir. Are you satisfied with your current speed and service? It is mostly fine, but sometimes the speed drops in the evening. I see Our new plan provides consistent speed even during peak hours. We also offer free installation and 24/7 customer support. Would you be interested in hearing about the pricing? Yes, you can tell me the price. We have a basic plan at ₹699 per month with unlimited data. And a higher speed plan at ₹899 per month. There are no hidden charges. OK, I will need some time to think about it. That is completely fine, sir. I can send you the plan details by message so you can review them. Yes, please send the details. Sure, I will send them shortly. If you have any questions, you can contact me directly. All right, thank you for the information. Thank you for your time, sir. Have a good day. You too, duck.
